# SnarkFold
SnarkFold: A novel proof aggregation scheme based on the folding scheme

# Introduction
SnarkFold is a novel SNARK-proof aggregation scheme based on the folding scheme proposed in Nova. It offers constant aggregated proof size and constant verification time. SnarkFold adopts a novel concept of incremental verification (IV), which is derived from incrementally verifiable computation (IVC) but tailored for proof aggregation. Our scheme is considered a verification-friendly scheme as the verifier only needs to validate the IV proof of the final recursive step, and the size of an IV proof is independent of the number of recursions.
